This is another example fo a way to have __strong text__ in our document. Anything between the two (2) opening underscore and closing underscore (_) will be displayed as __strong text__.

<!-- STRIKETHROUGH -->
This is an example of a ~~strikethrough~~ text, anything in between the double tilde (~) opening and closing characters will be displayed as ~~strike through~~ text.

<!--HORIZONTAL-->
We can add triple hyphens (-) to be able to create a horizontal line for separating content.

Another way to add __HORIZONTAL LINE__ is to add three (3) underscores (_).

<!--ESCAPE CHARACTER RULE USING BACKSLASH \ -->
This is an example of a *text with an asterisk*, When we don't want it to be italicized. We want to use the backslash to escape the rule of using an opening \*asterisk* and closing \*asterisk* to enclose the text content.

---

<!-- BLOCKQUOTE RULE-->
> We use the greater than symbol to display a block of text as a quote with a background and line on the left side.

> *"With great power comes with great responsibility!"* - __Uncle Ben__
